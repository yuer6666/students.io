				Tom’s Day
				Every day, Tom gets up at 8 o'clock in the morning. Then he reads his newspaper in the kitchen. He has
				breakfast at 11:30am and then he telephones his mother in Scotland.
				In the afternoon, at 1pm, Tom plays tennis with his sister. After that, they eat dinner in a restaurant
				together. At 6pm, Tom swims for one hour and then he goes by bike to his brother´s house. They talk and
				listen to music.
				Tom watches television in the evening and drinks a glass of warm milk before he goes to bed at 11:30pm.
				Grammar Learning Points:

				. We can use the Simple Present Tense to talk about repeated actions. This is why this tense is often
				used when talking about daily routines.

				. Please pay attention to “everyday” in green, this is a time indicator for using “simple present
				tense”, because it means the actions happen repeatedly.

				. Also, please compare what is marked in yellow in “Tom’s Day” to the chart below, pay attention to the
				structure of the simple present tense:
