            Every day, Tom gets up at 8 o'clock in the morning. Then he reads his newspaper in the kitchen. He has
            breakfast at 11:30am and then he telephones his mother in Scotland.<br>
            In the afternoon, at 1pm, Tom plays tennis with his sister. After that, they eat dinner in a restaurant
            together. At 6pm, Tom swims for one hour and then he goes by bike to his brother´s house. They talk and
            listen to music.<br>
            Tom watches television in the evening and drinks a glass of warm milk before he goes to bed at 11:30pm.
